# Competitions dont have to be listed here to show up on the site. This is
# for adding supplemental data that's not contained in the unoffical WCA
# public API, such as registration dates and WCA Live ID numbers. The site will
# function just fine without this info, but may be less useful.

# Note: All formatting here, including indentation, is extremely important.
# When adding a new comp, it's best to copy/paste a previous one to clone the
# fomatting precisely.

# Comps don't have to be listed below in any particular order. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
