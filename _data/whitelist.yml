# Competitions listed here will be shown on the site even if not organized
# by Utah Cubing Association. This is mainly useful for multi-location FMC
# competitions with a Utah location.

# Note the starting list is only United States competitions, so adding one
# from anywhere else in the world will not cause it to be displayed here.

# List competition ids with a markdown unordered list. Example:
 - NotARealCompetition2025
 
 - PBQtah82025
 - FMCLIVENorthAmerica2025
 - RockyMountainChampionship2025
